# About ebatte

ebatte is the first-ever Charge/Recycle2Earn battery platform on the market. Enabled by the AIoT power banks connected to the NEAR protocol, ebatte uses NFT games to incentivize the battery users to a ecofriendly lifestyle.

# Project Story

ebatte is an eco-friendly battery product and platform company that uses recyclable batteries based on WATMARÂ³ technology. Through the introduction of other partners, we realized that NEAR is an user-friendly web3 platform. ebatte hopes that through NEAR Protocol, we can promote the trustworthy recycling of battery products  thus comprehensively solving the problem of battery pollution.

Our initial product, the ebatte app, aims to promote users to upload battery usage information and actively participate in battery recycling through a token incentive on NEAR Protocol. To achieve this, the ebatte app implements the following two basic functions.

1. ed25519 asymmetric encryption-based trusted battery information management system.

ebatte builds a trusted battery information management system based on ed25519 asymmetric encryption, which encrypts and verifies the user's battery usage information through NEAR protocol.

First, at the manufactoring stage, ebatte would burn the private key in the SOC of the battery device (to be developed) and sends the signature to the app based on ed25519. The app uses this signature to build a smart contract on Near Protocal. When users use the battery, their usage information will be verified on the blockchain through this smart contract, and tokens will be awarded only when the verification is true.

This system ensures the trustworthiness of battery information at the usage end, thus allowing battery recyclers to choose the appropriate recycling method based on the user's usage information, thus reducing battery pollution. The ultimate goal of this system is to allow a trusted flow of battery information throughout its life cycle.

2. NEP token-based Charge/Recycle2Earn incentive system

ebatte has built a complete tokenomic on NEAR to incentivize users' eco-friendly behavior. Through smart contracts, ebatte provides a fungible token (eCoin, ECN) incentive for users using batteries to verify usage data (Charge2Earn), and a NFT incentive for users to recycle batteries(Recycle2Earn).

Specifically, when a user uses a battery product, ebatte provides FT rewards based on the user's hours of use with a reward factor based on the user's NFT collection. When the user recycles the battery, ebatte gives the user an NFT incentive of varying rarity based on the properties of the battery. Through this system we hope to promote users' recycling behavior and activate their environmental awareness.

# What's next

In the near future, we will deploy our algorithms to real-life hardware, starting from power banks. After verifying the mechanism, we will soon publish our tokenomics and trustworthy power banks to NEAR mainnet and the market.

Our ultimate goal is to achieve zero pollution in battery recycle. To do that, we are going to build a credible flow of information on battery production and use throughout the industry chain, with the help of our algorithms and NEAR protocol.
